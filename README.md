A Dynamically controlled particle system for the GM to play an animation of the ghost's path in AV.

To use: Add the Macro "Open Footsteps Control" from the Footsteps of Otari Macro folder.

Click on it to open the floating control window. If you havent modified the MapIDs it will auto-detect the path to play.
